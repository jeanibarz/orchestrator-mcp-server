You MUST ensure that no file exceeds 500 lines. If some files exceeds that length, refactor the code into separate, more granular modules.
Beware to NEVER add this kind of content when using write_in_file:
"""
</final_file_content>
"""

If having PYTHONPATH issues, ensure the package is installed in editable mode.
Python dependancies are managed by uv. Ensure you use uv to install new dependancies (or to install the package in editable mode).

*   **SAVE Command:** When the user says "SAVE", stop the current work immediately. Dump all current progress, context, thoughts, and next steps into `MEMORY_BANK/TASK_PROGRESS.md` in sufficient detail to allow resuming the task later, even after a complete memory loss. After saving, ask the user whether to continue with the current task or stop.

*   **RESUME Command:** When the user says "RESUME", start the workflow by checking `MEMORY_BANK/TASK_PROGRESS.md`. If the file contains information about a previous task, use it to resume from where it was left off. If the file is empty or doesn't contain actionable progress information, inform the user and ask if a new task should be started.

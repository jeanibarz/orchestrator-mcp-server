# Goal
Gather details from the user to create a new workflow.

# Orchestrator Guidance
If the user's report contains sufficient details (workflow name, description, and initial steps), proceed to "Plan Workflow Structure".
Otherwise, stay on this step to gather more information.

# Client Instructions
Check the context for the workflow name, description, and initial steps. If they are present, acknowledge the provided details and ask if anything is missing or needs to be changed. If some details are missing, ask for the specific missing information. If no details are present, ask the user for the name of the new workflow, a brief description, and the initial steps they envision.

# Goal
Handle errors that occur during workflow file creation or update.

# Orchestrator Guidance
Stay on this step to inform the user about the error and await their instructions (e.g., try again, modify the plan).

# Client Instructions
Inform the user that an error occurred while creating or updating the workflow files. Provide details about the error if available in the report. Ask the user how they would like to proceed (e.g., try again, go back to planning).

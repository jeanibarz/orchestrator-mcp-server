# Goal
Plan the detailed structure of the workflow (new or refined) with the user.

# Orchestrator Guidance
If the user's report indicates the workflow plan is finalized, proceed to "Create or Update Workflow Files".
Otherwise, stay on this step to continue planning with the user.

# Client Instructions
Present the gathered information for the workflow (name, description, initial steps/refinements). Propose a detailed workflow structure, including goals, orchestrator guidance, and client instructions for each step. Work with the user to refine the plan based on their feedback. Continue this process until the user confirms the plan is finalized.

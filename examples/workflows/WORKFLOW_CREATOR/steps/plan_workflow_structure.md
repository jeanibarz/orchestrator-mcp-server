# Goal
Plan the detailed structure of the workflow (new or refined) with the user.

# Orchestrator Guidance
If the user's report indicates the workflow plan is finalized, proceed to "Create or Update Workflow Files".
Otherwise, stay on this step to continue planning with the user.

# Client Instructions
Present the gathered information for the workflow (name, description, initial steps/refinements). Acknowledge how much detail was provided upfront. If a detailed structure was given, present it for review and refinement. If only initial steps or a basic description were given, propose a detailed workflow structure based on that, including goals, orchestrator guidance, and client instructions for each step. Work with the user to refine the plan based on their feedback. Continue this process until the user confirms the plan is finalized.

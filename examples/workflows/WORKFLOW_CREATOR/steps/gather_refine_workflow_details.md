# Goal
Gather details from the user to refine an existing workflow.

# Orchestrator Guidance
If the user's report contains the workflow name and details about the desired refinements, proceed to "Plan Workflow Structure".
If the user provides a workflow name but no refinement details, read the workflow files and stay on this step.
Otherwise, stay on this step to gather more information.

# Client Instructions
Ask the user for the name of the workflow they want to refine and what changes or additions they would like to make. If the user provides a workflow name, read the `index.md` and step files for that workflow to understand its current structure and provide context to the user.
